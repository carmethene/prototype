A. About Prototype
------------------

This is a scrolling shooter I wrote in my spare time after finishing Black & White 2.
The intention was to see how my programming abilities had improved during the course
of the project and to brush up on my DirectX programming skills.  I hope you enjoy it :).


----------------------
B. System Requirements
----------------------

Prototype requires a video card which supports v2.0 pixel shaders (So anything newer than
Radeon 9500 or nVidia GeForce FX ).  It will run without this, but the post-process glow
effect will be disabled, which severely degrades visual quality!

D. Reuse of assets
------------------

With the exception of FMOD, the DirectX Common Files Framework and the collision detection
routine I took from a gamedev.net article, all code is my own.  Feel free to use it in your
own projects but please give me credit.  The sound effects are licensed by Lionhead Studios Ltd
so please ask me first if you want to reuse those.  The font is freeware and came from
http://www.fontfreak.com/.  The art assets are from the DirectX SDK, but I have tweaked the
colours.
